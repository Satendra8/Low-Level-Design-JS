Need Revision
    Adapter = charger = same functionality but method name is different (MISE) - method inside method call
    Bridger = grow both interface independently - (AC, TV, Radio) (NormalRemote, SmartRemote) (IDIR) - interface device, interface remote
    Composite = File and Folder - Tree like structure - FNF
    Facade = (buy, payment, send notification) - combine all in one
